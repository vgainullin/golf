# Experiments: Improving Beyond Heuristic

## Game: 6-Card Golf

4 players, 9 holes, French deck (no jokers). Each player has 6 cards in a 2x3 grid, initially face-down. Two cards are revealed at deal.

**Scoring:** 2=-2, 3-9=face value, 10/J/Q=10, K=0, A=1. Column match (same rank in both rows of a column) zeroes both cards. Lower is better.

**Turn structure (2 stages):**
- Stage 0: Take the face-up discard pile card, or draw from the deck.
- Stage 1: Place the held card at any grid position (replacing that card, which goes to discard), or discard it and flip one face-down card.

Game ends when any player has all 6 cards revealed, then each other player gets one final turn.

**Heuristic strategy:**
- S0: Take face card if score < 4 or rank matches a revealed card (column match opportunity). Else draw.
- S1: Only considers placing at unrevealed positions. Place if improvement >= 4, or if it doesn't make score worse (information gain). Else discard + flip.
- Weakness: never swaps revealed cards to create column matches (theoretical 9.6 vs actual 14.0).

## Goal

Beat the heuristic baseline (~14.0/hole) using RL on top of an imitation-learned DQN.

| Baseline | Score (avg/hole) |
|----------|-----------------|
| Heuristic | ~14.0 |
| Imitation DQN | ~14.0 (matches heuristic) |
| Tournament RL (from scratch) | ~16.3 (never beats heuristic) |
| Improved heuristic (theoretical) | 9.6 |

Eval config: [DQN, Random, Heuristic, Random], 9 holes.

## Why tournament RL failed

1. Epsilon-greedy can't discover strategic improvements
2. Q-values drift with no anchor (catastrophic forgetting)
3. Co-adaptation when evaluating DQN vs DQN

## Experiment 1: Residual DQN with alpha scaling (2026-03-06)

**Commit:** `src/dqn_offline.py` (ResidualDQN), `src/residual_dqn.py`

**Approach:** `Q_total = Q_base + alpha * Q_residual`. Q_base is frozen imitation model. Q_residual is a fresh GolfDQNv2Shallow. Alpha scheduled 0.1 -> 1.0. Both DQN loss and margin loss computed on Q_total. Boltzmann exploration. Self-play [DQN, H, H, H]. Demo buffer from heuristic rollouts.

**Bug:** Alpha inside forward scales gradients by alpha. At alpha=0.1, effective LR = 1e-5. The residual can't flip action rankings -- needs to overcome Q_base logit gaps divided by alpha.

**Result:** DQN loss 13.5 -> 4.3 but eval flat at ~14.0. Best: **13.949** at iter 40 (alpha=0.45). Worse at alpha=1.0 (14.08) because residual was trained under damped gradients then given full weight.

---

## Experiment 2: Alpha removed from forward (2026-03-06)

**Fix:** Forward changed to `Q_base + Q_residual` (no alpha). Residual gets full gradients.

**Remaining bug:** DQN loss and margin loss still computed on Q_combined. Q_base is cross-entropy logits, not Q-values. Residual spends capacity correcting logit scale rather than finding better actions. Margin loss trivially satisfied (~0.001) since Q_base already ranks expert actions highest.

**Result:** Best **13.893** at iter 100. DQN loss 12 -> 3.7. Marginal improvement.

---

## Experiment 3: Losses on Q_residual alone (2026-03-06)

**Fix:** DQN loss computed on Q_res alone (TD targets from Q_res_target only). Margin loss on Q_res alone. Q_base only used for action selection in Double DQN next-action choice.

**Observations:**
- Margin loss now provides actual gradient: 0.6 -> 0.15 -> 0.78
- Margin loss *increases* after iter 50: Q_res learns different action preferences
- But eval flat at ~14.0 because `evaluate_model` uses argmax(Q_base + Q_res) and Q_base dominates

**Verification** (Q_res alone vs combined at iter 50 checkpoint):

| Model | Score |
|-------|-------|
| Q_base alone | 14.0 (heuristic) |
| Q_base + Q_res | 13.9 |
| Q_res alone | 18.2 (bad) |

Q_res hasn't learned a useful standalone Q-function.

**Result:** Best **13.802** at iter 50. Still within noise of heuristic.

---

## Diagnosis

The residual architecture is fundamentally wrong for this setting.

**Root cause:** Q_base outputs cross-entropy logits, not Q-values. Residual RL assumes Q_base is a valid Q-function. The logits dominate argmax(Q_base + Q_res) regardless of what Q_res learns, preventing any policy change.

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Q_base is logits, not Q-values | Not Bellman-consistent, arbitrary scale |
| Q_base dominates argmax | argmax(Q_base + Q_res) ~ argmax(Q_base) |
| Margin loss vacuous on Q_combined | Q_base satisfies margin -> zero gradient |
| No exploration diversity | Boltzmann on Q_combined still follows heuristic |

---

## Next directions

### A. Pure DQfD (recommended next)

Drop the residual. Train a standalone DQN with DQfD:

1. Initialize from imitation checkpoint (already matches heuristic)
2. Demo buffer from heuristic rollouts
3. Self-play [DQN, H, H, H] with Boltzmann exploration directly on Q
4. Margin loss on Q prevents forgetting (replaces Q_base's anchor role)
5. DQN loss on Q learns actual Q-values grounded in rewards

Key difference: Q IS the Q-function. Exploration acts on it directly. No logits blocking action divergence.

### B. n-step returns

Add n-step TD targets (n=3 or 5) alongside 1-step. Propagates reward signal faster through sparse-reward game. DQfD paper uses both.

### C. Prioritized experience replay

Focus learning on surprising transitions (high TD error). DQfD paper uses this with a demo priority bonus.

### D. Opponent diversity

Mix in random opponents or past checkpoints instead of all-heuristic. Creates more diverse game states for learning.

### E. Curriculum on critical decisions

Weight specific suboptimal heuristic decisions more heavily:
- Column matching (place high card to zero out a column)
- -2 vs -4 (joker) choice
- End-game timing

**Recommended order:** A -> A+B -> A+B+C

## Experiment 4: Pure DQfD (2026-03-06)

**Script:** `src/dqfd.py`

**Approach:** Initialize GolfDQNv2Shallow from imitation checkpoint. Train all parameters with DQN loss + margin loss. Mixed demo + self-play batches. Boltzmann exploration directly on Q. No residual wrapper.

### Run 1: lr=1e-4, lambda_margin decaying 1.0 -> 0.1

**Result:** Catastrophic forgetting by iter 80. DQN score collapsed to 28.8 (worse than random). The DQN loss reshaped logits into Q-values, destroying the policy. Margin loss too weak (0.05) with decaying lambda.

### Run 2: lr=3e-5, lambda_margin constant at 1.0

**Result:** Slower forgetting but same trajectory. Stable at ~14.0 through iter 80, then drifts up: iter 120 = 15.0, iter 150 = 16.5. DQN loss plateaued at ~2.0 but continued to erode policy. Best: **13.895** at iter 1 (essentially the imitation model).

### Diagnosis

The DQN loss is fundamentally destructive when starting from imitation logits. The model's outputs are cross-entropy logits with good action ranking but no Bellman consistency. The TD loss converts these to Q-values, which inevitably destroys the action ranking before the Q-values become useful. The margin loss can slow this but not prevent it because:

1. The margin only constrains the *expert* action to be best-by-margin -- it says nothing about the Q-value *scale*
2. The TD loss reshapes the entire output distribution, not just action ordering
3. By the time Q-values are Bellman-consistent, the policy is already degraded

### Key insight (REVISED -- see Experiment 5)

The diagnosis above was wrong. The real issue was a bug in transition recording: `next_obs` was captured immediately after the player's action, before opponents acted. The agent never sees that state -- it sees the board after all opponents complete their turns. This broke the Markov property, making TD targets inconsistent and causing the Q-values to diverge.

---

## Experiment 5: DQfD with next_obs fix (2026-03-06)

**Fix:** Defer stage-1 transition recording until the player's next turn, when the correct post-opponent-actions observation is available. Applied to `collect_demo_transitions`, `collect_agent_transitions` (residual_dqn.py), `train_episode`, and `train_episodes_vectorized` (tournament.py).

**Commit:** `38194d3`

### Vanilla tournament DQN (from scratch)

Re-ran tournament training with identical config to the `tournament_v2s` baseline (20 gens, 12 agents, v2s, seed 42).

| Metric | Old (stale next_obs) | Fixed |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Best solo score | 18.2 | **16.0** |
| Champion solo gen 20 | 18.3-19.0 | **16.2** |

The fix cut the solo-vs-heuristic gap roughly in half (4.2 -> 2.0).

### DQfD from imitation checkpoint

Re-ran DQfD with lr=1e-4, lambda_margin=1.0 constant, 200 iterations. Same config as Experiment 4 Run 1 but with correct transitions.

| Iteration | Old DQfD (Run 2, lr=3e-5) | Fixed DQfD (lr=1e-4) |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | 13.9 | 13.9 |
| 50 | ~14.0 | 14.3 (brief drift) |
| 100 | ~14.5 (degrading) | **13.6** (improving) |
| 150 | **16.5** (collapsed) | **13.6** (stable) |
| 200 | n/a | **13.5** |
| Best | 13.9 at iter 1 | **13.3** at iter 170 |

The DQN now **beats the heuristic baseline** (13.3 vs 14.0). No catastrophic forgetting through 200 iterations. The logit/Q-value transition that Experiment 4 diagnosed as "fundamentally destructive" is actually manageable when TD targets are computed from correct states.

### Why the fix matters

In a 4-player game, 3 opponents act between a player's turns. The stale `next_obs` reflected the board state immediately after the player's action, not the state they actually see next. This meant:

1. TD targets `r + gamma * Q(s')` used phantom states `s'` that never occur in actual play
2. The Q-function couldn't converge to correct Bellman values
3. The resulting gradient noise was destructive enough to overcome the margin loss anchor

With correct `next_obs`, the TD targets are consistent with the actual game dynamics, allowing the Q-values to converge properly while the margin loss preserves the policy.

### DQfD hyperparameter sweep (2026-03-07)

Tested whether higher LR and lower temperature would accelerate learning.

| Config | Best score | Iter at best | Plateau |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| lr=1e-4, temp 1.0->0.1 | **13.3** | 170 | ~13.3-13.6 |
| lr=1e-3, temp 0.3->0.1 | **13.3** | 195 | ~13.3-13.5 |

Both runs converge to the same plateau (~13.3). Higher LR makes the DQN loss converge faster (2.1 at iter 10 vs 3.3) but eval improvement is identical. The bottleneck is not gradient speed.

### Heuristic decomposition (2026-03-07)

Measured how much each strategic component contributes by testing variant heuristics in 4-player self-play (20k games, 9 holes, avg across all seats). Lower is better.

**Strategy isolation** (random draw/placement as controls):

| Variant | Avg/hole | vs random |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Random | 30.84 | -- |
| Random draw + base placement | 21.61 | -9.2 |
| Random draw + improved placement | 19.28 | -11.6 |
| Smart draw + random placement | 22.41 | -8.4 |
| Base (smart draw + smart placement) | 15.48 | -15.4 |
| Improved (base + place at revealed) | 11.73 | -19.1 |

Smart placement (-9.2) contributes more than smart draw (-8.4), and they synergize: combined (-15.4) beats the sum of individual contributions (-17.6). Taking good cards matters more when you place them well, and vice versa.

**Cutoff threshold sweep** (cutoff = minimum card score to take from discard):

| Cutoff | Simple (random place) | Base heuristic |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| 0 | 27.78 | 17.64 |
| 2 | 23.55 | 15.97 |
| 4 (default) | 22.41 | 15.47 |
| **5** | 21.69 | **15.39** |
| **6** | **21.37** | 15.81 |
| 8 | 22.06 | 18.39 |
| 11 | 30.83 | 30.85 |

Optimal cutoff shifts from 5 (base) to 6 (simple) -- without column awareness, it pays to be greedier about taking cards. Either way, tuning the threshold is worth at most **0.08-1.04 points** depending on variant. The DQN's 0.7 improvement over heuristic is not from finding a better threshold.

**Seat bias:** Improved heuristic shows strong first-mover advantage (seat 0: 10.65, seat 3: 12.62, std=0.73). Base heuristic has mild bias (std=0.16). Random/simple have none.

### Current plateau analysis

The DQfD plateaus at ~13.3 regardless of LR or temperature. The 0.7-point improvement over base heuristic (~14.0 in [DQN,R,H,R] eval) cannot be explained by threshold tuning (worth 0.08 at most). The model likely learns partial/situational column matching or better position selection, but has not discovered the full strategy of placing at revealed positions (worth 3.76 points).

Possible barriers to further improvement:

1. **Exploration limit:** Boltzmann on Q-values only perturbs around the current policy. Discovering "swap a revealed card for a column match" requires trying actions the heuristic never takes.
2. **Demo anchor ceiling:** The margin loss anchors to heuristic demonstrations. As the model improves beyond the heuristic, the margin loss pulls it back toward heuristic actions. Note: decaying lambda was blamed for catastrophic forgetting in Exp 4, but that was actually caused by the stale next_obs bug -- decaying lambda may now be safe to revisit.
3. **Opponent diversity:** Self-play is [DQN, H, H, H]. The model only sees games against heuristic opponents, limiting the state distribution.
