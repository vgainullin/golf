# Experiments: Improving Beyond Heuristic

## Goal

Beat the heuristic baseline (~14.0/hole) using RL on top of an imitation-learned DQN.

| Baseline | Score (avg/hole) |
|----------|-----------------|
| Heuristic | ~14.0 |
| Imitation DQN | ~14.0 (matches heuristic) |
| Tournament RL (from scratch) | ~16.3 (never beats heuristic) |
| Improved heuristic (theoretical) | 9.6 |

Eval config: [DQN, Random, Heuristic, Random], 9 holes.

## Why tournament RL failed

1. Epsilon-greedy can't discover strategic improvements
2. Q-values drift with no anchor (catastrophic forgetting)
3. Co-adaptation when evaluating DQN vs DQN

## Experiment 1: Residual DQN with alpha scaling (2026-03-06)

**Commit:** `src/dqn_offline.py` (ResidualDQN), `src/residual_dqn.py`

**Approach:** `Q_total = Q_base + alpha * Q_residual`. Q_base is frozen imitation model. Q_residual is a fresh GolfDQNv2Shallow. Alpha scheduled 0.1 -> 1.0. Both DQN loss and margin loss computed on Q_total. Boltzmann exploration. Self-play [DQN, H, H, H]. Demo buffer from heuristic rollouts.

**Bug:** Alpha inside forward scales gradients by alpha. At alpha=0.1, effective LR = 1e-5. The residual can't flip action rankings -- needs to overcome Q_base logit gaps divided by alpha.

**Result:** DQN loss 13.5 -> 4.3 but eval flat at ~14.0. Best: **13.949** at iter 40 (alpha=0.45). Worse at alpha=1.0 (14.08) because residual was trained under damped gradients then given full weight.

---

## Experiment 2: Alpha removed from forward (2026-03-06)

**Fix:** Forward changed to `Q_base + Q_residual` (no alpha). Residual gets full gradients.

**Remaining bug:** DQN loss and margin loss still computed on Q_combined. Q_base is cross-entropy logits, not Q-values. Residual spends capacity correcting logit scale rather than finding better actions. Margin loss trivially satisfied (~0.001) since Q_base already ranks expert actions highest.

**Result:** Best **13.893** at iter 100. DQN loss 12 -> 3.7. Marginal improvement.

---

## Experiment 3: Losses on Q_residual alone (2026-03-06)

**Fix:** DQN loss computed on Q_res alone (TD targets from Q_res_target only). Margin loss on Q_res alone. Q_base only used for action selection in Double DQN next-action choice.

**Observations:**
- Margin loss now provides actual gradient: 0.6 -> 0.15 -> 0.78
- Margin loss *increases* after iter 50: Q_res learns different action preferences
- But eval flat at ~14.0 because `evaluate_model` uses argmax(Q_base + Q_res) and Q_base dominates

**Verification** (Q_res alone vs combined at iter 50 checkpoint):

| Model | Score |
|-------|-------|
| Q_base alone | 14.0 (heuristic) |
| Q_base + Q_res | 13.9 |
| Q_res alone | 18.2 (bad) |

Q_res hasn't learned a useful standalone Q-function.

**Result:** Best **13.802** at iter 50. Still within noise of heuristic.

---

## Diagnosis

The residual architecture is fundamentally wrong for this setting.

**Root cause:** Q_base outputs cross-entropy logits, not Q-values. Residual RL assumes Q_base is a valid Q-function. The logits dominate argmax(Q_base + Q_res) regardless of what Q_res learns, preventing any policy change.

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Q_base is logits, not Q-values | Not Bellman-consistent, arbitrary scale |
| Q_base dominates argmax | argmax(Q_base + Q_res) ~ argmax(Q_base) |
| Margin loss vacuous on Q_combined | Q_base satisfies margin -> zero gradient |
| No exploration diversity | Boltzmann on Q_combined still follows heuristic |

## Next directions

### A. Pure DQfD (recommended next)

Drop the residual. Train a standalone DQN with DQfD:

1. Initialize from imitation checkpoint (already matches heuristic)
2. Demo buffer from heuristic rollouts
3. Self-play [DQN, H, H, H] with Boltzmann exploration directly on Q
4. Margin loss on Q prevents forgetting (replaces Q_base's anchor role)
5. DQN loss on Q learns actual Q-values grounded in rewards

Key difference: Q IS the Q-function. Exploration acts on it directly. No logits blocking action divergence.

### B. n-step returns

Add n-step TD targets (n=3 or 5) alongside 1-step. Propagates reward signal faster through sparse-reward game. DQfD paper uses both.

### C. Prioritized experience replay

Focus learning on surprising transitions (high TD error). DQfD paper uses this with a demo priority bonus.

### D. Opponent diversity

Mix in random opponents or past checkpoints instead of all-heuristic. Creates more diverse game states for learning.

### E. Curriculum on critical decisions

Weight specific suboptimal heuristic decisions more heavily:
- Column matching (place high card to zero out a column)
- -2 vs -4 (joker) choice
- End-game timing

**Recommended order:** A -> A+B -> A+B+C

## Experiment 4: Pure DQfD (2026-03-06)

**Script:** `src/dqfd.py`

**Approach:** Initialize GolfDQNv2Shallow from imitation checkpoint. Train all parameters with DQN loss + margin loss. Mixed demo + self-play batches. Boltzmann exploration directly on Q. No residual wrapper.

### Run 1: lr=1e-4, lambda_margin decaying 1.0 -> 0.1

**Result:** Catastrophic forgetting by iter 80. DQN score collapsed to 28.8 (worse than random). The DQN loss reshaped logits into Q-values, destroying the policy. Margin loss too weak (0.05) with decaying lambda.

### Run 2: lr=3e-5, lambda_margin constant at 1.0

**Result:** Slower forgetting but same trajectory. Stable at ~14.0 through iter 80, then drifts up: iter 120 = 15.0, iter 150 = 16.5. DQN loss plateaued at ~2.0 but continued to erode policy. Best: **13.895** at iter 1 (essentially the imitation model).

### Diagnosis

The DQN loss is fundamentally destructive when starting from imitation logits. The model's outputs are cross-entropy logits with good action ranking but no Bellman consistency. The TD loss converts these to Q-values, which inevitably destroys the action ranking before the Q-values become useful. The margin loss can slow this but not prevent it because:

1. The margin only constrains the *expert* action to be best-by-margin -- it says nothing about the Q-value *scale*
2. The TD loss reshapes the entire output distribution, not just action ordering
3. By the time Q-values are Bellman-consistent, the policy is already degraded

### Key insight (REVISED -- see Experiment 5)

The diagnosis above was wrong. The real issue was a bug in transition recording: `next_obs` was captured immediately after the player's action, before opponents acted. The agent never sees that state -- it sees the board after all opponents complete their turns. This broke the Markov property, making TD targets inconsistent and causing the Q-values to diverge.

---

## Experiment 5: DQfD with next_obs fix (2026-03-06)

**Fix:** Defer stage-1 transition recording until the player's next turn, when the correct post-opponent-actions observation is available. Applied to `collect_demo_transitions`, `collect_agent_transitions` (residual_dqn.py), `train_episode`, and `train_episodes_vectorized` (tournament.py).

**Commit:** `38194d3`

### Vanilla tournament DQN (from scratch)

Re-ran tournament training with identical config to the `tournament_v2s` baseline (20 gens, 12 agents, v2s, seed 42).

| Metric | Old (stale next_obs) | Fixed |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Best solo score | 18.2 | **16.0** |
| Champion solo gen 20 | 18.3-19.0 | **16.2** |

The fix cut the solo-vs-heuristic gap roughly in half (4.2 -> 2.0).

### DQfD from imitation checkpoint

Re-ran DQfD with lr=1e-4, lambda_margin=1.0 constant, 200 iterations. Same config as Experiment 4 Run 1 but with correct transitions.

| Iteration | Old DQfD (Run 2, lr=3e-5) | Fixed DQfD (lr=1e-4) |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | 13.9 | 13.9 |
| 50 | ~14.0 | 14.3 (brief drift) |
| 100 | ~14.5 (degrading) | **13.6** (improving) |
| 150 | **16.5** (collapsed) | **13.6** (stable) |
| 200 | n/a | **13.5** |
| Best | 13.9 at iter 1 | **13.3** at iter 170 |

The DQN now **beats the heuristic baseline** (13.3 vs 14.0). No catastrophic forgetting through 200 iterations. The logit/Q-value transition that Experiment 4 diagnosed as "fundamentally destructive" is actually manageable when TD targets are computed from correct states.

### Why the fix matters

In a 4-player game, 3 opponents act between a player's turns. The stale `next_obs` reflected the board state immediately after the player's action, not the state they actually see next. This meant:

1. TD targets `r + gamma * Q(s')` used phantom states `s'` that never occur in actual play
2. The Q-function couldn't converge to correct Bellman values
3. The resulting gradient noise was destructive enough to overcome the margin loss anchor

With correct `next_obs`, the TD targets are consistent with the actual game dynamics, allowing the Q-values to converge properly while the margin loss preserves the policy.

### DQfD hyperparameter sweep (2026-03-07)

Tested whether higher LR and lower temperature would accelerate learning.

| Config | Best score | Iter at best | Plateau |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| lr=1e-4, temp 1.0->0.1 | **13.3** | 170 | ~13.3-13.6 |
| lr=1e-3, temp 0.3->0.1 | **13.3** | 195 | ~13.3-13.5 |

Both runs converge to the same plateau (~13.3). Higher LR makes the DQN loss converge faster (2.1 at iter 10 vs 3.3) but eval improvement is identical. The bottleneck is not gradient speed.

### Current plateau analysis

The DQfD plateaus at ~13.3 regardless of LR or temperature. Possible explanations:

1. **Exploration limit:** Boltzmann on Q-values only perturbs around the current policy. It can find small improvements over the heuristic but can't discover fundamentally different strategies (e.g., column matching, endgame timing).
2. **Opponent diversity:** Self-play is [DQN, H, H, H]. The model only sees games against heuristic opponents, limiting the state distribution.
3. **Demo anchor ceiling:** The margin loss anchors to heuristic demonstrations. As the model improves beyond the heuristic, the margin loss pulls it back toward heuristic actions, creating tension with the DQN loss that wants to diverge.

The gap to improved heuristic (9.6) remains 3.7 points.
